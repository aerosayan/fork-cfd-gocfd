Awesome CFD solver written in Go 

## An implementation of the Discontinuous Galerkin Method for solving systems of equations

### Credits to Jan S. Hesthaven and Tim Warburton for their excellent text "Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Methods" (2007)

## Requirements
Here is what I'm using as a platform:
```
me@home:bash# go version
go version go1.14 linux/amd64
me@home:bash# cat /etc/os-release
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION="18.04.4 LTS (Bionic Beaver)"
...
```
You also need to install some X11 and OpenGL related packages in Ubuntu, like this:
```
apt update
apt install libx11-dev libxi-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev mesa-common-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
```
A proper build should go like this:
```
me@home:bash# $ make
go fmt ./...  && go install ./...
run this -> $GOPATH/bin/gocfd
me@home:bash# /gocfd$ gocfd --help
Usage of gocfd:
  -K int
        Number of elements in model (default 60)
  -N int
        polynomial degree (default 8)
  -delay int
        milliseconds of delay for plotting (default 0)
  -graph
        display a graph while computing solution
  -model int
        model to run: 0 = Advect1D, 1 = Maxwell1D (default 1)
```

### Model Problem Example #3: Euler's Equations in 1D - Sod's shock tube

The 1D Euler equations are solved with boundary and initial conditions for the Sod shock tube problem. There is an analytic solution for this case and it is widely used to test shock capturing ability of a solver.

Currently, the stability of the method is not matching what is described in the text examples, likely due to a subtle bug - the result is that the CFL limit is around 0.25. Also, many polynomial degrees exhibit marginal stability - indicating oscillations around the shocks.

Run the example with graphics like this:
```
bash# make
bash# gocfd -model 2 -delay 0 -graph -K 300 -N 8 -CFL 0.25
```

### Model Problem Example #2: Maxwell's Equations solved in a 1D Cavity

The Maxwell equations are solved in a 1D metal cavity with a change of material half way through the domain. The initial condition is a sine wave for the E (electric) field in the left half of the domain, and zero for E and H everywhere else. The E field is zero on the boundary (face flux out = face flux in) and the H field passes through unchanged (face flux zero), corresponding to a metallic boundary.



Run the example with graphics like this:
```
bash# make
bash# gocfd -model 1 -delay 0 -graph -K 80 -N 5
```

Unlike the advection equation model problem, this solver does have unstable points in the space of K (element count) and N (polynomial degree). So far, it appears that the polynomial degree must be >= 5 for stability, otherwise aliasing occurs, where even/odd modes are excited among grid points.

In the example pictured, there are 80 elements (K=80) and the element polynomial degree is 5 (N=5).

### Model Problem Example #1: Advection Equation
<span style="display:block;text-align:center">![](images/Advect1D-0.PNG)</span>

The first model problem is 1D Advection with a left boundary driven sine wave. You can run it with integrated graphics like this:
```
bash# gocfd -model 0 -delay 0 -graph -K 80 -N 5
```

In the example pictured, there are 80 elements (K=80) and the element polynomial degree is 5 (N=5).
